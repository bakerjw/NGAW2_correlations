# NGA-West2 IM correlations
This data and set of Matlab scripts reproduces the results presented in 

Baker, J. W., and Bradley, B. A. (2017). “Intensity measure correlations observed in the NGA-West2 database, and dependence of correlations on rupture and site parameters.” Earthquake Spectra, 33(1), 145–156.

The script mainScript.m calls the other scripts in the folder, and so is a good starting place when aiming to understand the code in this repository.
