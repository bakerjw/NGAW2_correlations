# NGA-West2 IM correlations
This data and set of Matlab scripts reproduces the results presented in

Baker, J. W., and Bradley, B. A. (2017). “Intensity measure correlations observed in the NGA-West2 database, and dependence of correlations on rupture and site parameters.” Earthquake Spectra, 33(1), 145–156.

The script mainScript.m calls the other scripts in the folder, and so is a good starting place when aiming to understand the code in this repository.

The data was updated in January 2021 to correct errors in the Z1 and region values associated with the ground motion database, and the code now produces figures that are slightly updated relative to the originally published results. Thank you to Eduardo Miranda and Alan Poulos for identifying the errors and helping resolve them.
